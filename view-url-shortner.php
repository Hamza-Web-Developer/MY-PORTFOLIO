                                The URL Shortener is a web-based application built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. This system allows users to convert long URLs into short, easy-to-share links while tracking their usage.
                                Key features include custom short URLs, link analytics (click tracking), expiration settings, and QR code generation. The interface, styled with Tailwind CSS, ensures a modern, clean, and responsive design, enhancing user experience across all devices. JavaScript provides real-time validation and interactive elements for smooth functionality.
                                Security measures such as preventing duplicate links, protecting against spam, and implementing safe redirection mechanisms ensure reliability. The system is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and scalable, making it an ideal solution for managing and sharing links easily.
