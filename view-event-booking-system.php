                                The Event Booking System is a web-based application developed using PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. This system enables users to browse, book, and manage event reservations seamlessly, providing an efficient platform for event organizers and attendees.
                                Key features include event listing, user registration, seat selection, booking confirmation, payment integration (optional), and an admin dashboard for managing events and reservations. With Bootstrap, the interface is fully responsive and visually appealing, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices.
                                Security measures such as user authentication, booking validation, and SQL injection prevention ensure safe and reliable event management. This project is ideal for businesses, organizations, and individuals looking to streamline event booking and attendee management effectively.
