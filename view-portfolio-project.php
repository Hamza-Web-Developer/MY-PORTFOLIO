This website serves as my digital identity, highlighting my expertise in PHP development, along with my knowledge in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL.
                                Through this portfolio, visitors can explore my projects, technical skills, experience, and achievements. The site features sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, Resume, Contact, and more, providing a structured way to present my work and capabilities.
                                The website is built with aesthetic UI, smooth navigation, Tailwind CSS, and responsiveness, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices. It also includes a contact form to facilitate easy communication. This project is a reflection of my passion for web development and a way to demonstrate my ability to build efficient and visually appealing web solutions.
