                                The User Authentication System is a secure and efficient web application built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. This system provides a seamless way to manage user authentication, ensuring secure access control for web applications.
                                It includes essential features such as user registration, login, logout, password hashing and session management. The system is designed with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive user interface, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate. JavaScript enhances the user experience by providing real-time validation and interactive elements.
                                With a focus on security, the system implements password encryption (using hashing algorithms like bcrypt), SQL injection prevention, and session handling to safeguard user data. This project serves as a foundation for integrating authentication into larger web applications, providing a robust and scalable solution for user management.
