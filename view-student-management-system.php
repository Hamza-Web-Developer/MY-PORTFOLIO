                                The Student Management System is a web-based application developed using PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. It is designed to efficiently manage student records, providing an organized and user-friendly interface for administrators, teachers, and students.
                                Key features include student registration, profile management, course enrollment, attendance tracking, grading system, and an admin dashboard for seamless data management. With Bootstrap, the system ensures a responsive and visually appealing interface that adapts to all devices, offering smooth navigation and accessibility.
                                Security measures such as user authentication, data validation, and SQL injection prevention ensure safe and reliable student data management. This project serves as a comprehensive solution for educational institutions looking to streamline student-related operations digitally.
